<a href="https://www.xml.com/articles/2022/03/01/invisible-xml/" class="link">Invisible XML</a> published
at <a href="https://www.xml.com/" class="link">XML.com</a> on 1 March 2022.
In this article, we’re going to focus on the syntax of Invisible XML documents and how
to write (and debug) grammars. If you’re not already familiar with the principles
behind Invisible XML, you may want to read the introductory article first.</p><section id="intro" class="section"><header><h2><span class="number">1<span class="sep">.</span>1<span class="sep"> </span></span>Introduction</h2></header><p>If you’re familiar with writing grammars in any
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form" class="link">BNF</a>
(or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form" class="link">EBNF</a>) form,
you’ll find Invisible XML easy to use. If you’ve never written a
grammar like this before, you’re in for a treat, this is fun!</p><p>You’ll soon discover that writing an Invisible XML grammar
shares a lot with writing an XML schema (defining a hierarchy of symbols) or a regular
expression (figuring out how to match an item and what to replace it with).
As we said last time, a <span class="firstterm">grammar</span> is a
collection of rules. Each rule has a “left hand side” and a “right
hand side”. The left hand side is a single symbol, the one being
defined, and the right hand side is a list of symbols that
define it. A <span class="firstterm">symbol</span> is either the name of
a symbol, in which case there must be a further rule that defines it,
or it’s something that
literally matches characters in your input.</p><p>This article describes the syntax of Invisible XML as published in the
draft specification of 22 February 2022. In the event that the community group
introduces grammar changes, we’ll try to make sure this article stays up-to-date.
</p><p>Invisible XML is defined by an Invisible XML grammar. It is an
instance of itself. The
<a href="https://invisiblexml.org/ixml-specification.html#complete" class="link">complete
grammar</a> is only about 45 rules. Printed, it would fit on one side
of a sheet of standard office paper.</p><p>Let’s dig in. We’re going to bounce around a little bit at
first, but eventually we’ll settle in to writing some longer, less
contrived grammars.</p><section id="playalong" class="section"><header><h3><span class="number">1<span class="sep">.</span>1<span class="sep">.</span>1<span class="sep"> </span></span>Play along at home!</h3></header><p>As you read this article and look at the examples it contains,
we encourage you to play along at home. You’ll learn a lot from trying
out the examples! As you learn new concepts, extend the examples and
try matching your own inputs.</p><p>For an even more interactive introduction to Invisible XML, check out

presented at <a href="https://declarative.amsterdam/" class="link">Declarative Amsterdam</a>
in 2021.</p><p>Steven’s tutorial includes <a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/ixml/tutorial/run.html" class="link">an
online form</a> where you can upload a grammar and an input file to
be processed. Alternatively, you can download <a href="https://coffeepot.nineml.org" class="link">CoffeePot</a>, a
command line Invisible XML processor that’s part of the <a href="https://nineml.org/" class="link">NineML</a> family of Invisible XML
tools. (It’s a Java application and should run easily on Linux, MacOS, and Windows computers.)</p></section><section id="howtoread" class="section"><header><h3><span class="number">1<span class="sep">.</span>1<span class="sep">.</span>2<span class="sep"> </span></span>Input or output?</h3></header><p>Writing grammars is about creating rules that match against
things in the input. Those rules are, in turn, used to create XML elements
and attributes that will appear in the output. These aren’t completely
independent. Annotations that you put in the grammar will influence
how the XML is created.</p><p>In this article, we’ve organized the two sections separately.
First, we’ll look at the input, and then we’ll talk about the output.
If you’re working through examples and starting to experiment with
grammars on your own, you may want to know something about the output
sooner rather than later. Feel free to skip back and forth. If you’ve never
written grammars of this type before, do read the first
few sections of “The input” about rules and matching first.</p><p>Bear in mind as you go that the goal of Invisible XML is to produce “visible XML”.
That’s not necessarily the final output form that you want. It’s “text to XML”, not
“text to DocBook 5.2 with embedded MathML and SVG.” There are other, better tools to
transform one flavor of XML into another, Invisible XML doesn’t have to do <em>all</em>
the lifting.</p></section></section><section id="input" class="section"><header><h2><span class="number">1<span class="sep">.</span>2<span class="sep"> </span></span>The input</h2></header><p>Before we begin looking at rules, we need to think about what is being
processed by them. If you have any experience with parsing technologies, you
may be used to the idea that processing an input has two phases: a lexical
analysis phase (“the lexer”) and a parsing phase (“the parser”).</p><p>The lexer decides what parts of the input are the actual tokens.
It might remove insignificant whitespace, strip out comments,
normalize strings, etc. The parser then operates on those tokens.
The lexer does a lot of important work and the lexer for one kind of parsing
(Java, for example) simply won’t work for another kind (Python, for example).
</p><p>If Invisible XML was going to work this way, it would have to
provide two sets of rules, one for lexing and one for parsing. That
would add all kinds of complexity to the language. Instead, Invisible
XML has the simplest possible lexer: your input string becomes a
sequence of characters.</p><p>What you’re matching in rules are the individual characters of
the input: every single one of them. This is one of the reasons that writing an
Invisible XML grammar feels a little bit like writing a regular expression.
As we’ll see, this makes some things a little more complicated, but overall
it greatly simplifies Invisible XML.</p><section id="rules" class="section"><header><h3><span class="number">1<span class="sep">.</span>2<span class="sep">.</span>1<span class="sep"> </span></span>Rules</h3></header><p>A rule has the form of a name (the left hand side) followed by a
colon, followed by <a href="#epsilon" class="link">zero</a> or more symbols
(the right hand side) followed by a full stop to end the rule. If more
than one symbol appears on the right hand side, they must be separated
by commas:</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>symbol-name: defining, symbols, here .</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>Invisible XML allows only a single rule for any given name. If
you want to express that a symbol can have two or more definitions,
separate the alternatives with semicolons. This rule says that a
“<code>thing</code>” is a “<code>this</code>”, followed by a
“<code>that</code>”:</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>thing: this, that .</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>This rule says that a “<code>thing</code>” is a “<code>this</code>” <em>or</em>
a “<code>that</code>”:</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>thing: this; that .</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>Whitespace around the punctuation is insignificant,
“<code>this;that</code>” is the same as “<code>this; that</code>” is
the same as “<code>this ; that</code>”. That’s true of all the rule
punctuation except that there must be at least one whitspace character between
consecutive rules.</p><div class="admonition note"><div><div class="icon">🛈︎</div><div class="body"><header><div class="title">Note</div></header><div><p>Speaking of insigificant differences, Invisible XML allows
either of two separators between the left- and right-hand sides of a
rule: colon (“:”) or equals (“=”). Likewise, it allows either of two
separators to mark alternatives: semicolon (“;”) or vertical line
(“|”). In this article, I will consistently use “:” and “;”, but you’re
free to use “=” and “|” if you find them easier to read or remember.</p></div></div></div></div><p>Most grammars contain more than one rule. Rules are
separated by whitespace. It’s good practice, simply for readability,
to start each rule on its own line, but it’s not strictly required.</p></section><section id="rhs" class="section"><header><h3><span class="number">1<span class="sep">.</span>2<span class="sep">.</span>2<span class="sep"> </span></span>Organizing the “right hand side”</h3></header><p>The Invisible XML specification introduces a few nonterminals
(remember, Invisible XML is defined in Invisible XML!) to organize how
we think about the symbols that appear on the right hand side of a
rule. It will be convenient later to talk about how these are
combined, so let’s take a moment to lay out some vocabulary.</p><p>At the highest level, what appears on the right hands side of a
rule is a series of alternatives. A series of alternatives 
is composed of one or more individual <em>alternatives</em>
separated from each other by “;” (or “|”). Each alternative
is composed of a series of <em>terms</em> separated by “,”. A
term is composed of <em>factors</em>. A factor is either
a terminal; a nonterminal; or another set of alternatives surrounded
by parentheses. In other words, like content models or regular expressions, you can
put parentheses around a set of alternatives and then use that group as
a factor, a part of another grouping.
</p><p>For example, in the following rule:</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>memo: recipient, (date, sender ; sender, date), content .</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>The left hand side “<code class="symbol">memo</code>” is defined as
a single alternative composed of three terms: “<code class="symbol">recipient</code>”,
a grouped alternative in parentheses, and “<code class="symbol">content</code>”.
The first and
third terms contain a single factor each (and each of those
factors is a nonterminal not defined in this example). The second term is
a set of two alternatives enclosed in parenthesis; each of those
alternatives is composed of two terms (each a single nonterminal
factor) separated by commas.</p></section><section id="literals" class="section"><header><h3><span class="number">1<span class="sep">.</span>2<span class="sep">.</span>3<span class="sep"> </span></span>Matching literal characters</h3></header><p>A grammar consists of nonterminals, the symbols you define with rules,
and terminals, symbols that match characters explicitly in your input.
There are a few options for matching characters in your input.</p><section id="strings" class="section"><header><h4><span class="number">1<span class="sep">.</span>2<span class="sep">.</span>3<span class="sep">.</span>1<span class="sep"> </span></span>Matching strings</h4></header><p>You can match a literal string of text by using its quoted value.
The following rule says that the nonterminal symbol
<code class="symbol">jan</code> matches the literal string “January”.</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>jan: "January".</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>This rule says that “<code class="symbol">month</code>” matches any of the
Gregorian calendar month names in English:</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>month: "January"; "February"; "March"; "April";</code></span></span>
<span class="line" db-line="2"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>       "May"; "June"; "July"; "August";</code></span></span>
<span class="line" db-line="3"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>       "September"; "October"; "November"; "December" .</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>This might be a good time to try out a grammar. Save those three
lines in a plain text file named <code class="filename">month.ixml</code> and see
if you can make your first XML document with Invisible XML.</p><p>You can do this with <span class="application">CoffeePot</span> at the command line like this:</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>coffeepot -g:month.ixml March</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>(Depending on how you’ve installed <span class="application">CoffeePot</span>, you may need to
use <code>java -jar</code> or some other variation to run <span class="application">CoffeePot</span>. See
the documentation for details. You may also get some additional log messages
before the output shown below, depending on how you have things configured).</p><p>Which will print:</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>&lt;month&gt;March&lt;/month&gt;</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>Or you can do this using Steven’s form-based interface at
<a href="https://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/ixml/tutorial/run.html" class="link">https://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/ixml/tutorial/run.html</a>:
</p><div class="mediaobject"><div class="imageobject"><div class="media"><span class="viewport-table" style="width:800px;"><span class="viewport-row"><span class="viewport-cell"><span class="viewport"><img src="./form.png" style="width:800px;"/></span></span></span></span></div></div></div><p>Which returns:</p><div class="mediaobject"><div class="imageobject"><div class="media"><span class="viewport-table" style="width:800px;"><span class="viewport-row"><span class="viewport-cell"><span class="viewport"><img src="./result.png" style="width:800px;"/></span></span></span></span></div></div></div><p>Strings can be delimited by either single quotes (') or double
quotes ("). There’s no difference between the two forms except that
it’s easy to put double quotes inside single ones and single
quotes inside double ones. The string <code>'"hello"'</code> matches
the string <code class="literal">"hello"</code> with the quote marks; the string
<code>"don't"</code> matches the string <code class="literal">don't</code> with
the apostrophe.</p><p>If the string you want to match contains
<em>both</em> double <em>and</em> single quotes, you can escape one
inside the other by doubling them. The string <code>"I said ""there""."</code>
matches <code class="literal">I said "there".</code>. Similarly, <code>'don''t'</code>
matches <code class="literal">don't</code>. Note that in each case, these are
the ordinary, non-typographic quotes, "
(<a href="https://unicode-explorer.com/c/0022" class="link">U+0022</a>) and '
(<a href="https://unicode-explorer.com/c/0027" class="link">U+0027</a>). If
your string contains typographic quotes, those are just ordinary
characters as far as Invisible XML is concerned.</p><p>String literals in Invisible XML are not allowed to break across
lines. You cannot put a literal newline character in a string. To match
newline characters, use an
<a href="#encoded" class="link">encoded character</a>.</p><p>You might be wondering what happens if your input <em>doesn’t</em> match.
You can try that out by, for example, trying to match the month “Marsh” in the previous
examples.</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>coffeepot -g:month.ixml Marsh</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p><span class="application">CoffeePot</span> will print:</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>&lt;fail xmlns:ixml="http://invisiblexml.org/NS" ixml:state="failed"&gt;</code></span></span>

</pre></div><p>An Invisible XML processor always produces an XML result. In
this case, the result has been annotated with a “<code>failed</code>”
state and some attempt has been made to describe what went wrong. Like
most error messages from computers, it needs to be taken with a grain
of salt. The processor doesn’t <em>know</em> what’s wrong
in any meaningful sense, it just reports what state it was in when it gave up.</p><p>Steven’s form offers a similar report:</p><div class="mediaobject"><div class="imageobject"><div class="media"><span class="viewport-table" style="width:800px;"><span class="viewport-row"><span class="viewport-cell"><span class="viewport"><img src="./badresult.png" style="width:800px;"/></span></span></span></span></div></div></div></section><section id="encoded" class="section"><header><h4><span class="number">1<span class="sep">.</span>2<span class="sep">.</span>3<span class="sep">.</span>2<span class="sep"> </span></span>Matching individual characters</h4></header><p>You can match any literal character, including newlines and
<a href="#nonxml" class="link">other
control characters</a>, with an encoded character. An encoded character is
a number sign (#,
<a href="https://unicode-explorer.com/c/0023" class="link">U+0023</a>)
followed by hex digits. A newline is “#a” (or in capitals, “#A”, or with
leading zeros, “#000a”, if you prefer).
The encoded form can represent
<a href="#nonxml" class="link">any Unicode character.</a></p><p>In the discussion of strings, we noted that you cannot put a newline
in a string. So how would you match “one” followed by “two” separated by a single
newline?</p><p>One way is like this:</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>onetwo: "one", #a, "two" .</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>The commas that you put in to separate tokens don’t imply any delimiters
in the input.</p></section><section id="sets" class="section"><header><h4><span class="number">1<span class="sep">.</span>2<span class="sep">.</span>3<span class="sep">.</span>3<span class="sep"> </span></span>Character sets</h4></header><p>Strings and encoded characters match against the input exactly
as they are written. Another way to match is with <em>character
sets</em> which can be inclusive (all these characters) or
exclusive (any characters except these).
</p><p>Character sets are delimited by square brackets and contain
literal strings, encoded characters, character ranges, or Unicode
character classes. If the opening square bracket is preceded by a “~”
(<a href="https://unicode-explorer.com/c/007E" class="link">U+007E</a>),
the set is exclusive, otherwise it’s inclusive.</p><p>The following rule:</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>digit: ["0123456789"] .</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>Doesn’t match the string zero through nine, as it would if it wasn’t
surrounded in square brackets, instead it matches exactly one character, any
one of “0”, “1”, “2”, …, “9”.</p><p>Another way to write that would be with a range:</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>digit: ["0"-"9"] .</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>A range consists of a character string containing a single character (or an
<a href="#encoded" class="link">encoded character</a>)
followed by a hyphen-minus
(-, <a href="https://unicode-explorer.com/c/002D" class="link">U+002D</a>),
followed by another single
character string (or encoded character). Unlike ranges in most regular
expressions, the members of a character set are always quoted or
encoded, so you don’t need extra escaping. A character set that
includes left square bracket, both kinds of quote marks, and all of
the characters from “-” to “\” could be written:</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>["[", "'", '"', "-"-"\"]</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>though it might be a little easier to read as</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>["[", "'", '"', #2d-"\"]</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>or even</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>[#5b, "'", '"', #2d - "\"]</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>Finally, a set can identify a Unicode character class. Unicode groups
similar characters together into classes identified by one- or two-letter codes.
The code “P”, for example, identifies all punctuation characters while “Pd”
identifies those punctuation characters that are dashes. You can use these
classes in character sets. To define the nonterminal “<code class="symbol">punct</code>” that matches
any single Unicode punctuation character, you can write this:</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>punct: [P] .</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>You can combine these various forms in a single set:</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>hexplus: ["0123456789"; "A"-#46; #61-"f"; Nd].</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>That defines “hexplus” as matching any single character zero
through nine, or any upper-case latter “A” through “F”, or any
lowercase letter “a” through “f”, or any character in the Unicode
character class “Number, Decimal Digit” (which contains more than 600

defines a “<code class="symbol">name</code>”, for example the name of a
rule:</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>        name: namestart, namefollower*.</code></span></span>

full stop (., <a href="https://unicode-explorer.com/c/002E" class="link">U+002E</a>),

characters in the class Nd (decimal digit numbers),
and characters in the class Mn (nonspacing marks).</p><p>That’s the technique you have to employ if you want to make
sequences of characters. This example is a tiny bit complicated by the
fact that “name start” characters are different from the rest of the
name characters. If the whole sequence came from the same repertoire, you
could simply say something like: “<code>name: namecharacter+</code>”.</p><div class="admonition note"><div><div class="icon">🛈︎</div><div class="body"><header><div class="title">What’s in a name?</div></header><div><p>If you carefully compare what’s allowed as a name in Invisible XML with what’s

the Invisible XML grammar is very, very slightly more generous than
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/" class="link">XML 1.0 (Fifth Edition)</a>.
Invisible XML allows three characters in names that XML forbids:
feminine ordinal indicator,
<a href="https://unicode-explorer.com/c/00AA" class="link">U+00AA</a>
(ª),
micro sign,
<a href="https://unicode-explorer.com/c/00B5" class="link">U+00B5</a>
(µ), and masculine ordinal indicator,
<a href="https://unicode-explorer.com/c/00BA" class="link">U+00BA</a>
(º). Second, you will find that very few XML parsers have really taken
the broader repertoire of name characters defined in the fifth edition on board. The popular
Apache Xerces parser, for example, rejects thousands of characters that should be allowed
in names.</p></div></div></div></div></section><section id="whitespace" class="section"><header><h4><span class="number">1<span class="sep">.</span>2<span class="sep">.</span>5<span class="sep">.</span>2<span class="sep"> </span></span>Matching whitespace</h4></header><p>Whitespace in Invisible XML is defined as:</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>           s: (whitespace; comment)*.</code></span></span>

three of them, or <em>none</em> of them.

Nevertheless, ambiguous grammars can slow down the parser and
different implementations may give different answers, so it’s best to
avoid them if you can. Consider this somewhat contrived example:</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>seq: (A; B), '.'*.</code></span></span>

</pre></div><p><span class="application">CoffeePot</span> will tell you that there were two possible parses, but
it only returns one of them by default because that’s conformant
behavior for a processor. Internally, it enumerates the parses and returns the first. You can
ask for the other parse by passing <code>--parse:2</code> on the command line
(alternatively, you can pass <code>--parse:all</code> for
all of them.) Here’s the second parse:</p><div class="pre-wrap highlight"><pre class="language-xml programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>&lt;seq xmlns:ixml="http://invisiblexml.org/NS"</code></span></span>

</pre></div><p>Ambiguity arises because there’s more than one way to parse an
input. In this case, it’s pretty easy to see that the ambiguity is
whether the second “<code class="literal">.</code>” is part of the
<code class="symbol">A</code> or part of the “<code class="symbol">seq</code>”. Removing that
ambiguity involves choosing one of the options and then adjusting the
grammar to make that the only possible parse. In this case, one option
is to make sure all the full stops are associated with either the
<code class="symbol">A</code> or the “<code class="symbol">B</code>”:
</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>seq: A; B.</code></span></span>

</pre></div><p>Neither answer is more correct than the other. Which one is “right”
depends on the output you want to get.</p><p>Ambiguity is a broader, and more nuanced topic, than we have space for here.
It’s possible to make distinctions between <em>grammars</em> that are ambiguous
and <em>parses</em> that are ambiguous. Try parsing <code class="literal">a.</code>
with the first grammar above and you’ll find that there’s only one parse. Invisible
XML reports ambiguous parses, not ambiguous grammars. It’s also possible to write a
grammar that has loops in it: <code>seq: 's', seq; seq; .</code> An “<code class="symbol">seq</code>” is an
<code class="literal">s</code> or an “<code class="symbol">seq</code>” or nothing. That grammar is infinitely
ambiguous because it can have an unbounded number of empty “<code class="symbol">seq</code>” matches.

match nothing. Anytime you use a “<code>*</code>” or “<code>?</code>”
modifier on a symbol, you’re indicating that the symbol can be absent.
Another way to think about “can be absent” is “can match the empty
string”. Consider</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>seq: 'x', 'o'*, 'x'.</code></span></span>

this simple case), but consider a grammar for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan" class="link">North
American phone numbers</a>.
</p><p>Ignoring the country code, a phone number in North America
consists of an area code, a prefix (technically a central office
code), and a number (technically a station number), canonically: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_telephone_number" class="link">512‑555‑0100</a>
Unfortunately, you’ll also find (512) 555‑0100, common before the
prefix was largely mandatory, 512 555 0100, or even 5125550100.
Sometimes the area code will be missing altogether since it isn’t
<em>always</em> required. You might write a grammar for

</pre></div><p>What this says, somewhat cryptically, is that
<code class="symbol">sep</code> matches the empty strings at positions 3 and 6 in
two different ways: either by matching an omitted dash or an omitted
space. You can fix this changing how “<code class="symbol">sep</code>” is defined:</p><div class="pre-wrap" db-startinglinenumber="1" db-numberoflines="8"><pre class="language-none long numbered programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="ld"><code>phone-number: (areacode, sep)?, prefix, sep, number .</code></span></span>
<span class="line" db-line="2"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>-sep: (dash; space)? .</code></span></span>
<span class="line" db-line="3"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>-dash: -'-' .</code></span></span>
<span class="line" db-line="4"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>-space: -' ' .</code></span></span>
<span class="line" db-line="5"><span class="ln">5</span><span class="ld"><code>number: digit, digit, digit, digit .</code></span></span>

<span class="line" db-line="8"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>-digit: ['0'-'9'] .</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>Now a “<code class="symbol">sep</code>” is an optional dash or space, but
those aren’t independently optional. And the grammar is no longer
ambiguous. (It also no longer accepts optional separators between
every digit. Reader challenge: rewrite the grammar so that’s allowed
without reintroducing ambiguity.)</p><p>Another common pattern that can introduce ambiguity is when you
want to ignore whitespace. Consider this small grammar for a language
a little bit like Invisible XML:</p><div class="pre-wrap" db-startinglinenumber="1" db-numberoflines="12"><pre class="language-none long numbered programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="ld"><code>         rule: name, s?, ':', s?, symbol+s .</code></span></span>

</pre></div><p>It only accepts a single rule with a name before the colon and a
sequence of whitespace separated symbols after the colon. This grammar works perfectly well
and will parse “<code class="literal">a: b c</code>” just the way you’d expect. Now let’s
add <a href="#output" class="link">optional marks</a>:</p><div class="pre-wrap" db-startinglinenumber="1" db-numberoflines="14"><pre class="language-none long numbered programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln">1</span><span class="ld"><code>         rule: name, s?, ':', s?, symbol+s .</code></span></span>

<span class="line" db-line="14"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>-namefollower: namestart; ["-.·‿⁀"; Nd; Mn].</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>A symbol is now an optional mark, followed by optional whitespace. This introduces
ambiguity in the parse of <code class="literal">a: b c</code>.
If you look at the output of <code class="literal">--describe-ambiguity</code>,
you’ll find that the problem is in the expansion of “<code class="symbol">rule</code>”.
Imagine how you might expand “<code class="symbol">rule</code>”, substituting the value of
<code class="symbol">symbol</code> where it occurs in “<code class="symbol">rule</code>”:</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>rule ⇒ name, s?, ':', s?, mark?, s?, name …</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>Can you see the source of the ambiguity? If there is no mark in the input, but there
is a space after the colon, there will be two ways to resolve that space.
After the colon, we could match the empty string with the first <code class="literal">s?</code>,
the empty string for <code class="literal">mark?</code>, and the space for the second <code class="literal">s?</code>.
Alternatively, we could do it the other way around: match the space before the mark and the
empty string after it.</p><p>One way to resolve this ambiguity is to change the definition of
symbol:</p><div class="pre-wrap" db-startinglinenumber="1" db-numberoflines="1"><pre class="language-none numbered programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>       symbol: (mark, s?, name); name .</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>This definition still allows an optional mark, but there’s no
second space unless there <em>is</em> a mark, in which
case there is no ambiguity about how to consume the space after the
colon in the rule.</p><p>Your first thought might have been to simply remove the
space after the colon:</p><div class="pre-wrap" db-startinglinenumber="1" db-numberoflines="2"><pre class="language-none numbered programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>         rule: name, s?, ':', symbol+s .</code></span></span>
<span class="line" db-line="2"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>       symbol: mark?, s?, name .</code></span></span>
</pre></div><p>This will parse <code class="literal">a: b c</code> unambiguously. It will
also parse <code class="literal">a: b ^c</code> and <code class="literal">a:^b ^c</code>.
But it will not parse <code class="literal">a: ^b ^c</code>. Can you work out why?

</pre></div><p>Pretty soon after the observation, “cool, it works!”, you’ll
probably want to see about getting rid of all those extra “digit” elements.
The Invisible XML grammar allows you to annotate rules, nonterminals,
and terminals with extra symbols, called “marks” in the specification,
to control how they’re used to construct XML.
</p><p>The mark on a nonterminal controls how it’s serialized. If a particular
nonterminal on the right-hand-side of a rule doesn’t have a mark, the mark
on the rule that defines that nonterminal is the default. The marks are:</p><dl class="variablelist"><dt class="varlistentry"><span class="term"><code class="literal">^</code> (the default mark)</span></dt><dd><p>A “^” is the default. On a nonterminal, it indicates that an
element should be created using the name of the nonterminal and what
matches the nonterminal should be inside it. On a terminal, it indicates
that the terminal should appear in the output.
</p></dd><dt class="varlistentry"><span class="term"><code class="literal">@</code></span></dt><dd><p>An “@” only applies to nonterminals. It indicates that an
attribute should be created using the name of the nonterminal and what
matches the nonterminal should appear in the attribute value.
</p></dd><dt class="varlistentry"><span class="term"><code class="literal">-</code></span></dt><dd><p>A “-” suppresses output. On a nonterminal, it suppresses the
name of the nonterminal, not its content. On a terminal, it suppresses
the text of the terminal.
</p></dd></dl><p>Now we can go back to the grammar and suppress all those extra
digit elements. Replacing the rule for
“<code class="symbol">digit</code>” with this one:</p><div class="pre-wrap"><pre class="language-none programlisting verbatim verblines"><span class="line" db-line="1"><span class="ln"></span><span class="ld"><code>-digit: ["0"-"9"] .</code></span></span>

your input. In the preceding example, “<code class="symbol">day</code>” and “<code class="symbol">month</code>”
come before “<code class="symbol">year</code>”,
but marking “<code class="symbol">year</code>” with “@” still works. This is in contrast to languages
like XSLT and XQuery where attributes, if you have any, must come before
the first non-attribute (and non-namespace) child.</p></li><li><p>Even though you can have attributes that come “after” non-attributes,
