    <p>Top-level catalog for tests in the iXML Community Group
    Test Suite.</p>
    <p>Tests have been contributed from several sources, but
    the core of the test collection are the tests contributed

    <p>Grammars 21-40.</p>
    <p>Test grammars compiled manually in 2018 and 2019,
    re-packaged in 2022.</p>
    <p>Added test cases where needed and moved to ixml test

	<p>An attempt to isolate the bug caused by the initial version

	<p>(Plan:  Play code golf.  Start with 03, cut the grammar

	  <p>This test case illustrates one way different
	  processors will differ in detection of ambiguity.  Since
	  formalists define grammars as having sets of production
	  rules, formally the grammar given is just an odd way of
	  writing the grammar "name = ['a'-'z']."  The appearance of
	  having two distinct right-hand sides is only an
	  illusion.</p>
	  <p>On one analysis, the sentence is unambiguous, because
	  there is only one parse tree for the sentence using the
	  nonterminal of the grammar specified.</p>
	  <p>On another view, the sentence is ambiguous, because
	  either the first inclusion or the second inclusion of the
	  production rule for S will be used, and both produce the
	  same result.</p>
	  <p>The spec allows variation, so the test suite does
	  not take sides.</p>
