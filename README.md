# CoffeeFilter, an Invisible XML parser in Java

This package provides an implementation of an [Invisible XML](https://invisiblexml.org/) parser.

It will read grammars in Invisible XML, parse inputs against them, and return the results.

This work depends heavily on the [CoffeGrinder](https://github.com/nineml/coffeegrinder) parser.

This project is just the Invisible XML API. It doesn’t *do* anything
out of the box. A complete Invisible XML processor built on top of this library
is available in the [CoffeePot](https://github.com/nineml/coffeepot) repository.
